            <p>Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing every industry, and web development is no exception. From intelligent code completion to automated testing, AI tools are making developers more productive than ever before.</p>
            <h3>The Rise of AI Copilots</h3>
            <p>Tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor are changing the game. They don't just autocomplete syntax; they understand context and can generate entire functions or components based on natural language descriptions.</p>
            <h3>Will AI Replace Developers?</h3>
            <p>The short answer is no. AI is a tool, not a replacement. It handles the repetitive boilerplate code, allowing developers to focus on high-level logic, architecture, and user experience. The developers who will thrive in the future are those who learn to leverage these AI tools effectively.</p>
            <p>At Soft Brillante, we integrate AI training directly into our full-stack curriculum, ensuring our students are ready for this new era of development.</p>

        excerpt: 'React is great, but Next.js is the standard for production-grade React applications.',
        content: `
            <p>React has long been the library of choice for building user interfaces. However, as applications grow in complexity, developers often need more than just a view layer. This is where Next.js comes in.</p>
            <h3>Server Components & Performance</h3>
            <p>With the introduction of React Server Components, Next.js allows you to render components on the server, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client. This results in faster page loads and better SEO.</p>
            <h3>Full Stack Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Next.js isn't just a frontend framework. With API routes and Server Actions, you can build full-stack applications entirely within a single Next.js codebase. This simplifies deployment and project structure.</p>

            <p>The MERN stack remains one of the most popular choices for building web applications. It's JavaScript all the way down, making it easy to learn and versatile to use.</p>
            <h3>1. Foundation</h3>
            <p>Start with HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES6+). Understanding the basics is crucial before jumping into frameworks.</p>
            <h3>2. Frontend with React</h3>
            <p>Learn components, props, state, and hooks. Then, level up with Next.js for routing and server-side rendering.</p>
            <h3>3. Backend with Node & Express</h3>
            <p>Learn how to build RESTful APIs, handle JSON data, and manage authentication.</p>
            <h3>4. Database with MongoDB</h3>
            <p>Understand NoSQL databases, schema design with Mongoose, and data aggregation.</p>
